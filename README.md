# BAM File Size Reducers

Reduce BAM file size by removing tags and quality information (>50 %) and/or downsampling.

It happens fairly often that there is excess information in BAM files such as quality values and attributes which are not necessary for their display in some applications such as IGV. This can be especially cumbersome multi-laned RNA-sequencing runs. So far this package includes three simple scripts:

- `bam_reducer` - This script eliminates quality values and attribute tags as requested. Optionally, one can provide a `SJ.out.tab` as generated by the [STAR aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR). 
- `bam_downsampler` - This script will randomly drop reads by a user given fold difference
- `split_bam` - Split a bam file by a number of lines. For extremely large files, this script can be useful for distributing the tasks among a cluster.
